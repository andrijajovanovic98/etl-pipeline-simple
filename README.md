It is a very simple ETL pipeline built with the following tech stack:

- **Python**
- **Requests** (for API data fetching)
- **Pandas** (for data transformation)
- **SQLAlchemy** (for database operations)
- **SQLite** (as the database)

## Pipeline Steps

- Fetch the data from an API
- Clean and transform it
- Load it into SQLite
